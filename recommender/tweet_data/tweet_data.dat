Just ~0.4% of extra economic growth over 10 yrs fills the $1.5T revenue gap that allows for tax cuts. We're talking about going from 1.9% to 2.3% GDP - and we're at 3% growth now. If you’d like to have smaller deficits then pass this legislation. https://t.co/vNjs9v4K8i

@ozzyogkush @fox43 @RepJoePetrarca @RepHarris @RepMcClinton @RepReedPA @PADems @PaHouseDems @PaSenateDems Well sure. But is there really a point? I mean it will never pass with a GOP majority. And even if it did, Congress isn't going to act because PA tells them to, and even if they did, Trump would veto it. I'm not a huge fan of empty gestures. You want change?? Win more elections!!
@randyzgirlz4 Uh...this article is about gerrymandering.
@IndictmentHappy LOL. Yup. That was all me. The fact I votes against it was just a clever ploy to hide my dictatorial powers!

@NathanBenefield @FreedomWorks @marcy_tomlin @jgrahambell1 @Liberty4pa Nate. You've been wrong about almost everything you've said. My first experience w/U was when you said a gym in Lehigh laid off 100 people when minimum wage went up. I went to that gym. They didn't even have 100 employees total. Just made up. It's been like that ever since.
@ozzyogkush @fox43 @RepJoePetrarca @RepHarris @RepMcClinton @RepReedPA @PADems @PaHouseDems @PaSenateDems Agreed, although word is the Feds will move to preempt and block state actions
This reminds me of other great historical treatises, such as President William Henry Harrison's "Time of Destiny, the White House Month" or the book by the cast of La La Land, "High on the Mountaintop! Our 74 seconds as Oscar Winners".    https://t.co/9HQEiP7boB
@FreedomWorks @marcy_tomlin @jgrahambell1 @Liberty4pa @NathanBenefield LOL. That's funny. Because over the past 15 years I've been following it, EVERY ONE of the Commonwealth Foundation's "studies" had results that perfectly fit their ideology. It's really hard to be that perfect. But they pull it off!
@RealGabbyR Well, they changed it slightly for that effect. But the point is the same. Gerrymandering screws us.
@marcy_tomlin @jgrahambell1 @Liberty4pa @NathanBenefield Well, what's interesting, is that the Com. Foundation has a very clear ideological view. And they do studies, and 100% of the results support their view! Not once have they said "we thought it would come out this way, but we were wrong". It must be awesome to be infallible~!!
@RakKeefe I am a liberal, why wouldn't I listen to them, and instead listen to plutocracy-funded right-wing "think" tanks?
Cool graphic and good article by Eric Holder. But with the case heading to the PA Supreme Court, this wretched #gerrymandering  designed to make sure you never matter in an election, may be coming to an end in the next few weeks.   https://t.co/SAzlmSVhAR
@dlreddy14051 God...me too!
What? This is a perfectly normal and dignified way for a #POTUS to act! It's similar to when Jefferson called Adams "that wretched mucus pastry" or when Ike sent his famous "Adlai is a Poopyhead" memo. #infant https://t.co/BhpZST9EgF
@GlennCraven @NormOrnstein Ironically that's exact what the electoral college does. A national popular vote turns it into a 50 state race.  Under EC, no candidate has a reason to go to Boston or Utah. But under PV, they do. A vote is a vote.
This is good. But unless these wealthy people now give a max check of $5,400 to all candidates who opposed the tax bill and now seek to replace Congressmen who supported the bill, its an empty gesture. Only winning elections changes policy.  https://t.co/S7Clft1AEv

Our #TaxReform bill increases the Child Tax Credit, lowers the tax burden on every income bracket, especially lower income families, while creating more high wage jobs. This is a good deal for all Americans, and the proof will be in people's paychecks: https://t.co/W1wjSV3ZNr
I hope my Democratic colleges will join us in working on #TaxReform that lowers taxes for middle income families. Nothing precludes my friends across the aisle from offering amendments, engaging in debate, and working with us on this bill. Watch: https://t.co/ZW6T3a7SyJ
137 leading economists agree: Economic growth will accelerate if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passes, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and a better standard of living for the American people.

@BoyerandRitter @RMSides @PPG @ShipleyEnergy @PAManufacturers Kevin from @DellickerS in Germansville says our tax code is so complex that “I spend between $5K-10K a year just filing my tax returns, let alone paying the actual rate.” #TaxReform will simplify the tax code &amp; ease the burden on small businesses. https://t.co/aQNuELWQYm

The @GOPSenFinance #TaxReform bill will help PA families in 2 big ways: 1. We lower your federal tax bill. More money for you, less for Uncle Sam. 2. We take arguably the worst business tax code, and make it the best, driving up wages. Learn more: https://t.co/6wgQGi8kff
We want to free Americans from the onerous burden of the individual mandate tax, which unduly effects low-income Americans. We will take this up in tomorrow's @GOPSenFinance #TaxReform markup. Watch my @CNBCClosingBell segment to learn more: https://t.co/xmiueoRcbw

@SenSchumer Funny coming from @SenSchumer, who has probably never met a tax he didn't want to hike. Facts: GOP #TaxReform offsets loss of SALT deduction with larger standard deduction and lower rates while ending incentive for big spending liberal politicians to increase taxes.
